      Hi! I&apos;m Milon Miah, a passionate frontend web developer with a strong
      focus on React, Next.js, and the MERN stack. I’m currently pursuing a
      degree in Software Engineering at China West Normal University, where I’ve
      completed over 20 projects, including a hospital management system, an
      online learning platform, and various other web applications. With a solid
      foundation in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and modern frameworks like React and
      Next.js, I aim to create highly efficient, scalable, and user-friendly
      applications. I’m also skilled in using tools such as Tailwind CSS for
      clean and responsive designs. Additionally, my backend knowledge with
      Express.js, MongoDB, and Node.js allows me to develop full-stack solutions
      that meet the needs of both users and businesses. Throughout my journey,
      I’ve gained valuable experience in building and deploying applications
      that emphasize performance, accessibility, and seamless user experiences.
      My ability to work with state management libraries like Redux and Tanstack
      Query, along with integrating third-party APIs, allows me to handle
      complex web functionalities. I’m always eager to learn and improve,
      constantly exploring new technologies and methodologies to enhance my
      skills. I thrive on solving challenging problems and am committed to
      staying up-to-date with the latest trends in web development. My ultimate
      goal is to contribute to impactful projects that provide real value to
      users while continually pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in web
      development.
